# DiamondTheft
A diamond figure is placed in the center and it is surrounded by swirling arch blocks. The game is played in such a way that the mouse cursor should be moved from outside of the blocks to the very center so that the player can reach the diamonds. If the blocks are touched then the Game is over.
